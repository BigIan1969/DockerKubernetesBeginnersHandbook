## Chapter 2: Your First Docker Container

Now that Docker is successfully installed on your system, it's time to dive into the core of containerization: running your very first Docker container. This chapter marks a pivotal moment in your learning journey, moving from theoretical understanding to practical application. We'll demystify the relationship between Docker Images – the read-only blueprints for your applications – and Docker Containers – the live, runnable instances of those images. You'll learn how to pull pre-built software from the vast Docker Hub registry and execute it with a single command, witnessing firsthand the speed and simplicity that containers bring to deploying applications.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be comfortable with the docker run command and its essential options, allowing you to not only launch containers but also to interact with them, observe their output, and manage their lifecycle. We'll cover how to list running containers, stop them, start them, and even remove them when they're no longer needed. This hands-on experience will provide you with the fundamental skills required to operate Docker, setting a solid foundation for building your own custom images and orchestrating more complex applications in the chapters to come.
